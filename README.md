> work in progress

I can't recommend [this course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer) enough.

Things I learnt in the first course:
* Week 1: built elementary gates (And, Or, Not, Xor) and variations of DMux, Mux using NAND gates (also learnt a simplistic HDL)
* Week 2: built an ALU, Full Adder, Half Adder, etc.
* Week 3: built 1-bit register using DFF, 16-bit register, Program counter, RAM chip with storage upto 16K
* Week 4: learnt to use `Hack` Assembly (an assembly language created in this course)
* Week 5: built a CPU capable of running `Hack` machine code and a Memory chip (with Screen Memory and Keyboard register)
* [Week 6](./week-6): wrote an assembler in `python` for `Hack` assembly

## long term aim
